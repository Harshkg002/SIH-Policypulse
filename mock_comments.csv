1|~|Law Firm|~|Clause 4.1|~|The definition of 'significant data fiduciary' under Clause 4.1 is overly broad and grants what amounts to arbitrary power to the regulatory authority. This vagueness could inadvertently create a surveillance mechanism, which is a cause for serious concern.
2|~|Small Business|~|Section 12|~|The penalties outlined in Section 12 are completely disproportionate for small businesses. A single excessive fine could wipe out our entire company. This stifles innovation and protects larger players.
3|~|Citizen|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble's vision is flawed. It talks about competition but seems to be setting up more government control. I am worried about my personal data.
4|~|Industry Association|~|Clause 8.3|~|Clause 8.3 imposes a significant operational burden on tech companies. The requirements for cross-border data transfer are too restrictive and will create unnecessary friction, which hinders global business.
5|~|Academics|~|Section 21|~|The dispute resolution mechanism proposed in Section 21 lacks academic rigour and comparative analysis with international best practices. It appears to be a cumbersome process with insufficient checks and balances.
6|~|Citizen|~|Clause 4.1|~|I am very worried about the data sharing concerns in Clause 4.1. Who will have access to my information? This could lead to a data monopoly by a few powerful companies.
7|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Section 12|~|While we support accountability, the penalties in Section 12 seem designed to be an undue burden on smaller entities and non-profits working in the digital space. This needs reconsideration.
8|~|Industry Association|~|Preamble|~|We commend the Ministry's initiative. The Preamble sets a positive and forward-looking tone for digital innovation in India.
9|~|Law Firm|~|Section 21|~|The proposed timelines for dispute resolution under Section 21 are unrealistic. The process, as described, is cumbersome and lacks transparency, potentially making it biased towards government entities.
10|~|Small Business|~|Clause 8.3|~|We are a small SaaS company with clients abroad. Clause 8.3 is a nightmare for us. This restrictive clause adds so much paperwork and cost, it directly hinders global business for startups like us.
11|~|Industry Association|~|Clause 4.1|~|The provisions in Clause 4.1 regarding data fiduciary responsibilities are a welcome step towards creating a level playing field and building consumer trust in the digital ecosystem.
12|~|Citizen|~|Section 12|~|These fines are crazy! How can a normal person or a small shop owner pay this? It's just not fair.
13|~|Academics|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble is ambitious but lacks clarity on its core objectives. The document's vision is flawed from the outset because it fails to define key terms like 'digital competition' adequately.
14|~|Law Firm|~|Clause 8.3|~|The framework for cross-border data transfer in Clause 8.3 introduces an operational burden that is not commensurate with the stated regulatory objectives. This creates unnecessary friction for global operations.
15|~|Small Business|~|Section 21|~|The dispute process in Section 21 seems very complicated. We don't have lawyers on staff. It feels like a cumbersome process designed for big companies only.
16|~|Citizen|~|Clause 4.1|~|This clause gives the government too much power. It feels like surveillance. My data should be my property.
17|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble's focus on innovation is appreciated, but it is ambiguous on how it will protect user rights and prevent the exploitation of digital citizens.
18|~|Industry Association|~|Section 12|~|The proposed penalty framework in Section 12 is a significant concern for our members. The quantum of the fine is excessive and could stifle innovation, making investors wary.
19|~|Academics|~|Clause 4.1|~|Clause 4.1's approach to data privacy appears to conflate the roles of data controller and processor, creating legal ambiguity and raising data sharing concerns.
20|~|Law Firm|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble, while well-intentioned, is legally ambiguous. Its broad statements could be subject to wide interpretation, leading to future litigation. The stated vision is flawed without precise definitions.
21|~|Small Business|~|Clause 4.1|~|This clause will create a data monopoly for the big tech giants who can afford the compliance. We have huge data sharing concerns as we will be forced to use their platforms.
22|~|Citizen|~|Section 21|~|Who will listen to a common person in this dispute process? It looks like it is biased towards government and big companies. There is no transparency.
23|~|Industry Association|~|Section 21|~|We suggest the formation of an independent regulatory body for dispute resolution as the mechanism in Section 21 lacks transparency and may not be impartial.
24|~|Academics|~|Clause 8.3|~|The restrictive nature of Clause 8.3 on cross-border data flows does not align with the principles of a globalised digital economy. It may inadvertently isolate the Indian market.
25|~|Law Firm|~|Section 12|~|The penalty provisions in Section 12 are prima facie disproportionate. The lack of a clear graded mechanism based on the severity of the offense is a significant legal flaw that will stifle innovation.
26|~|Small Business|~|Preamble|~|The big ideas in the Preamble sound nice, but how does it help a small business owner? It lacks clarity for people like us.
27|~|Citizen|~|Clause 8.3|~|I don't understand all the details, but making it harder to use global services seems like a bad idea. This seems very restrictive.
28|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Clause 4.1|~|Clause 4.1 must include stronger safeguards against state surveillance. The current draft leaves too much room for misuse of arbitrary power by authorities.
29|~|Industry Association|~|Clause 8.3|~|We strongly recommend a re-evaluation of Clause 8.3. The current draft poses a serious operational burden that will negatively impact the ITES and BPO sectors.
30|~|Academics|~|Section 12|~|The economic rationale behind the quantum of penalties in Section 12 is unclear. There is a risk that such an excessive fine structure will deter market entry and investment.
31|~|Law Firm|~|Section 21|~|The appellate procedure outlined in Section 21 is inadequate. The lack of a specialised tribunal makes the process cumbersome and questions the fairness of the resolution.
32|~|Small Business|~|Section 12|~|This is not a fine, it's a death sentence for startups. This is an undue burden. Please reconsider this section entirely.
33|~|Citizen|~|Preamble|~|I'm glad the government is thinking about this. The preamble shows a good intention to make things fair for everyone. I support this.
34|~|Academics|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble is a statement of intent, but its vision is flawed as it seems to prioritize control over enabling genuine, ground-up innovation. The language is ambiguous.
35|~|Law Firm|~|Clause 4.1|~|We submit that Clause 4.1's criteria for data classification are nebulous. This ambiguity raises data sharing concerns and may lead to over-compliance or non-compliance due to uncertainty.
36|~|Industry Association|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble's objective to foster digital competition is laudable. Our association is ready to work with the Ministry to ensure the bill achieves its goals.
37|~|Small Business|~|Section 21|~|How can a small business fight a case with this process? The whole thing lacks transparency and seems designed to favour the powerful.
38|~|Citizen|~|Section 12|~|The fine mentioned is disproportionate. A mistake online shouldn't cost a person their life savings.
39|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Clause 8.3|~|Clause 8.3's data localisation mandate is restrictive and could hamper the work of international non-profits operating in India that rely on global infrastructure.
40|~|Academics|~|Section 21|~|The dispute resolution framework in Section 21 should incorporate Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods to reduce the burden on the formal system. The current process is too cumbersome.
41|~|Law Firm|~|Clause 8.3|~|The compliance requirements under Clause 8.3 are an operational burden that will disproportionately affect MSMEs. It hinders global business integration for emerging Indian companies.
42|~|Small Business|~|Clause 4.1|~|The broad powers in Clause 4.1 can be misused. It gives the government arbitrary power to demand any data from us at any time.
43|~|Citizen|~|Clause 4.1|~|Stop this surveillance! I don't want the government or companies creating a monopoly on my personal information.
44|~|Industry Association|~|Section 12|~|The fear of incurring an excessive fine as per Section 12 will have a chilling effect on innovation and risk-taking, which are essential for a vibrant digital economy.
45|~|Law Firm|~|Preamble|~|The legal enforceability of the Preamble is questionable. While aspirational, its ambiguous phrasing, such as 'equitable digital ecosystem', lacks clarity for judicial interpretation.
46|~|Academics|~|Clause 4.1|~|The bill needs to clearly define the principles for data collection, not just its classification. As it stands, Clause 4.1 raises serious data sharing concerns among partner nations.
47|~|Small Business|~|Clause 8.3|~|The rules in Clause 8.3 add unnecessary friction. We use global cloud services. Does this mean we have to stop? This is a huge operational burden.
48|~|Citizen|~|Section 21|~|I have no faith in this process. It will be slow, expensive, and biased towards the government. Total lack of transparency.
49|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Section 21|~|For citizens and non-profits, the dispute resolution process in Section 21 is not accessible. It is a cumbersome process that needs simplification and a clear timeline.
50|~|Industry Association|~|Section 21|~|The framework for dispute resolution in Section 21 is a positive step. However, we recommend a fixed and shorter timeline for resolution to improve business confidence.
51|~|Law Firm|~|Section 12|~|The term 'repeated non-compliance' is not defined in Section 12, making the imposition of the highest penalties arbitrary. This provision is an undue burden on businesses.
52|~|Small Business|~|Preamble|~|This whole bill is ambiguous. I read the Preamble and I still don't know what it means for my online store.
53|~|Citizen|~|Preamble|~|The vision is flawed because it ignores the common citizen. It's all about corporations and government control.
54|~|Industry Association|~|Clause 4.1|~|We are concerned that the compliance load from Clause 4.1 could lead to a data monopoly, as only a few large players will be able to afford the infrastructure, defeating the bill's purpose.
55|~|Academics|~|Clause 8.3|~|Clause 8.3's policy on cross-border data transfer appears protectionist. It may create unnecessary friction with international trade agreements and digital partnership pacts.
56|~|Law Firm|~|Clause 4.1|~|The lack of a 'right to be forgotten' or explicit data minimisation principles in Clause 4.1 is a significant omission and allows for potential surveillance.
57|~|Small Business|~|Section 12|~|This disproportionate fine structure in Section 12 is a barrier to entry. Why would anyone start a new digital business with this kind of risk?
58|~|Citizen|~|Clause 8.3|~|Does this mean the apps and websites I use daily will stop working? This rule seems like it hinders global business and affects us all.
59|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Preamble|~|The bill's preamble needs to explicitly state the protection of freedom of expression and privacy as a core objective. The current version lacks clarity on this front.
60|~|Industry Association|~|Clause 8.3|~|While we understand the need for regulation, the approach in Clause 8.3 is too restrictive. A whitelist approach for 'safe' countries would reduce the operational burden significantly.
61|~|Academics|~|Section 12|~|Penalties should be corrective, not punitive. The structure in Section 12 appears excessively punitive and may stifle innovation rather than encourage compliance.
62|~|Law Firm|~|Section 21|~|The adjudication process under Section 21 lacks provisions for interim relief, which can cause irreparable harm to businesses during a prolonged dispute. This is a cumbersome process.
63|~|Small Business|~|Section 21|~|There is a clear lack of transparency in how the dispute committee in Section 21 will be formed. It feels biased towards government interests.
64|~|Citizen|~|Section 12|~|An excessive fine for a small mistake is unjust. This is an undue burden on ordinary people.
65|~|Industry Association|~|Section 21|~|We appreciate the inclusion of a dispute resolution mechanism. To enhance it, we suggest incorporating industry experts into the adjudication panel for specialised matters.
66|~|Law Firm|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble's vision is flawed as it conflicts with certain principles of the IT Act, 2000. There is a need for harmonisation to avoid legal ambiguity.
67|~|Small Business|~|Preamble|~|The language is too complicated. The vision lacks clarity for a non-lawyer.
68|~|Citizen|~|Clause 4.1|~|My biggest fear is the data sharing concerns. Clause 4.1 does not do enough to protect me from having my data sold or misused.
69|~|Academics|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble is commendable in its scope. It rightly identifies the need to balance innovation with regulation in the digital sphere.
70|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Section 12|~|The disproportionate fines in Section 12 could be used to silence critics or shut down organisations that are not in favour with the government.
71|~|Industry Association|~|Clause 4.1|~|We seek clarification on the interoperability requirements under Clause 4.1. As written, they may impose significant technical and financial burdens.
72|~|Law Firm|~|Clause 8.3|~|The prior approval mechanism in Clause 8.3 is a form of pre-censorship on data flow and creates unnecessary friction. It is a restrictive clause that will slow down business.
73|~|Small Business|~|Clause 4.1|~|This data privacy clause seems to give arbitrary power to officials. One inspection could shut us down.
74|~|Citizen|~|Preamble|~|The preamble sounds good but I am skeptical. The vision is flawed if the implementation is not citizen-friendly.
75|~|Academics|~|Section 21|~|The lack of a mandatory public disclosure of proceedings and outcomes in Section 21 is a major flaw. It points to a lack of transparency in the proposed system.
76|~|Industry Association|~|Preamble|~|We support the Preamble's intent to create a fair digital marketplace. This is a crucial step for India's digital future.
77|~|Law Firm|~|Section 12|~|The bill must clearly define the mitigating and aggravating factors for determining penalties under Section 12. Without this, the fines are an undue burden and potentially unconstitutional.
78|~|Small Business|~|Clause 8.3|~|This cross-border data rule is a massive operational burden. We will have to hire a new compliance officer we cannot afford.
79|~|Citizen|~|Section 21|~|The process is too complicated. It's a cumbersome process for a normal citizen to even understand, let alone participate in.
80|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Clause 4.1|~|We are deeply concerned about the potential for this bill to create a surveillance state. Clause 4.1 needs stronger privacy protections.
81|~|Academics|~|Clause 4.1|~|The bill's approach to data ownership is not clearly articulated in Clause 4.1. This could lead to a data monopoly where users have little control over their own information.
82|~|Industry Association|~|Section 12|~|A one-size-fits-all penalty in Section 12 is counterproductive. The fines should be proportional to the size of the entity and the nature of the violation, otherwise it is an undue burden.
83|~|Law Firm|~|Section 21|~|The composition of the dispute resolution authority under Section 21 suggests a potential for executive overreach. The process appears biased towards the government.
84|~|Small Business|~|Section 12|~|This fine stifles innovation. We were planning to launch a new feature but now we are scared of making any mistake.
85|~|Citizen|~|Clause 8.3|~|This sounds very restrictive. I am worried I will lose access to international educational platforms.
86|~|Industry Association|~|Clause 8.3|~|We propose a framework of 'Data Transfer Agreements' as a more flexible alternative to the restrictive pre-approval mechanism in Clause 8.3. This will reduce unnecessary friction.
87|~|Academics|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble is ambiguous about whether its focus is consumer protection or economic regulation. This lack of clarity undermines the entire document.
88|~|Law Firm|~|Preamble|~|The vision stated in the Preamble, while noble, lacks a coherent implementation strategy within the subsequent clauses, making it fundamentally flawed.
89|~|Small Business|~|Clause 4.1|~|There are serious data sharing concerns here. We work with third-party vendors, and this clause makes our legal liabilities very unclear.
90|~|Citizen|~|Section 12|~|The fine is disproportionate to any harm that could be caused by an individual. This is not justice.
91|~|Non-Profit Organization|~|Section 21|~|The dispute resolution process is not independent. The fact that the committee is appointed by the same ministry that is a party to the dispute shows it is biased towards government.
92|~|Industry Association|~|Section 21|~|We welcome the structured approach to dispute resolution in Section 21. It provides a clear path for businesses to address grievances.
93|~|Law Firm|~|Clause 4.1|~|Clause 4.1 may inadvertently encourage data localisation, which can lead to a data monopoly and increased state surveillance, contrary to its stated goals.
94|~|Small Business|~|Section 21|~|This cumbersome process for disputes is not feasible. We cannot afford to stop our work to attend hearings.
95|~|Citizen|~|Preamble|~|Finally, a law that seems to care about our digital rights. The preamble gives me hope.
96|~|Academics|~|Clause 8.3|~|The operational burden created by Clause 8.3 may lead to 'splinternets', where the Indian internet is isolated from the global one. This hinders global business and knowledge sharing.
97|~|Industry Association|~|Preamble|~|The Preamble's focus on 'financial innovation' is welcome. This bill has the potential to position India as a global leader in FinTech.
98|~|Law Firm|~|Section 12|~|The penalties in Section 12 are punitive rather than reformative. Such a disproportionate fine will undoubtedly stifle innovation, especially in the startup ecosystem.
99|~|Small Business|~|Clause 8.3|~|This clause is too restrictive. It creates unnecessary friction for simple tasks like using international accounting software.
100|~|Citizen|~|Section 21|~|The whole dispute process lacks transparency. How can we trust a system that operates behind closed doors? It feels biased towards government.
